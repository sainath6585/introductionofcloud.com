         <h1 style="font-size:60px"><center>INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD</center></h1>
        <center><p>We take a deep dive into the world of cloud computing, the different types of services it provides, and its applications in the world.</b></p></center>
        <center><img src="1st.jpg.jpeg"></center>
<P style="font-size: 20px;">The digital industry changes almost daily. Technology is growing and changing, and it can be tricky to keep on top of all the new developments and creations. And while cloud computing isn’t necessarily a new development, it’s only been in recent years that companies have started to turn to it.<br>

<br>The impact that cloud computing has had on the data industry and end-users in general is difficult to overstate. Many aspects of everyday life have been altered and transformed by this innovative digital solution.<br> 

<br>From start-ups through to established businesses, cloud computing has helped optimise costs and increase offerings. This is because they no longer require extra hardware and software.<br>

<br>But for many, the world of cloud computing remains oblique and confusing. We’ll give you an overview of cloud computing, and show how it can be used in all sorts of domains, from developers through to the world of cyber security<br></P><hr>
<H2><b>What is cloud computing?</b></H2>
<p ><li style="font-size: 20px;">To put it very simply, cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources as a service. Moving to the cloud basically means that the resources are owned and managed by a third-party provider, instead of the end-user.</li>
<li style="font-size: 20px;">This means that you don’t need to worry about hard drives, main-frames, or where any of this hardware and software is located. As far as you, the user, is concerned, it’s floating up there in a metaphorical ‘cloud’ – which you’re able to access via the internet. </li>
<li style="font-size: 20px;">This shift from software and hardware that was on-premises to a networked, remote resource has meant that companies no longer have to worry about investing in labour, expertise, or capital for the maintenance of these resources. It has spawned a plethora of cloud computing companies, including key players like AWS and Microsoft Azure</li></p>

<h3><b>Types of cloud computing services</b></h3>
<p><li style="font-size: 20px;">Cloud computing services are delivered in three main models, each of which offers customers different levels of support and flexibility. There’s also some overlap between all three of them, so it can get a little confusing when trying to get your head around what they all mean.</li>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">These services are occasionally known as the cloud computing ‘stack’ as they are often built on top of one another. Knowing what each one of them is, and how they work, will give you a clearer sign about which service might be best suited to your needs and requirements.<</li></p>
    <h4>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h4>
    <p ><li style="font-size: 20px;">Also known as utility computing, this is the on-demand delivery of computing infrastructure. That means everything – from operating systems and storage to networking and components – is outsourced to a cloud computing company or service. As the individual or the company, you’ll buy what you need on a pay-as-you-go model.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">The simplest example of IaaS cloud computing is ordinary web-hosting. This is where you pay a monthly fee or by megabyte/gigabyte to have a company host your files from their servers. IaaS is an extremely flexible option, as it permits the user to customise the infrastructure of the computing environment. From web-hosting to big data analytics, IaaS covers the whole spectrum.</li></p>
        <center><img src="18th.jpg.jpg"></center>
        <h2><b>Advantages of cloud computing</b></h2>
<p ><li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Cost:</b> It reduces the huge capital costs of buying hardware and software.</li>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Speed:</b> Resources can be accessed in minutes, typically within a few clicks.</li>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Scalability:</b> We can increase or decrease the requirement of resources according to the business requirements.</li>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Productivity:</b>While using cloud computing, we put less operational effort. We do not need to apply patching, as well as no need to maintain hardware and software. So, in this way, the IT team can be more productive and focus on achieving business goals.</li>
<li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Reliability:</b>Backup and recovery of data are less expensive and very fast for business continuity.</li>
<li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Security:</b> Many cloud vendors offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen our data security.</li>
<h2>Types of Cloud Computing</h2>
<center><img src="3rd.jpg.png"></center>
<p><li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Public Cloud:</b> The cloud resources that are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider are termed as public clouds. It delivers computing resources such as servers, software, and storage over the internet</li>
<li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Private Cloud:</b> The cloud computing resources that are exclusively used inside a single business or organization are termed as a private cloud. A private cloud may physically be located on the company’s on-site datacentre or hosted by a third-party service provider.</li>
<li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Hybrid Cloud:</b> It is the combination of public and private clouds, which is bounded together by technology that allows data applications to be shared between them. Hybrid cloud provides flexibility and more deployment options to the business.</li></p>
<h3><b>Types of Cloud Services</b></h3>
<center><img src="4th.jpg.png"></center>
<p><li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>
1.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</b> In IaaS, we can rent IT infrastructures like servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems from a cloud service vendor. We can create VM running Windows or Linux and install anything we want on it. Using IaaS, we don’t need to care about the hardware or virtualization software, but other than that, we do have to manage everything else. Using IaaS, we get maximum flexibility, but still, we need to put more effort into maintenance.</li>
<li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</b> This service provides an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. The developer is responsible for the application, and the PaaS vendor provides the ability to deploy and run it. Using PaaS, the flexibility gets reduce, but the management of the environment is taken care of by the cloud vendors.</li>\
<li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Software as a Service (SaaS): </b>It provides a centrally hosted and managed software services to the end-users. It delivers software over the internet, on-demand, and typically on a subscription basis. E.g., Microsoft One Drive, Dropbox, WordPress, Office 365, and Amazon Kindle. SaaS is used to minimize the operational cost to the maximum extent.</li></p>

<h2>Value proposition</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Advocates of public and hybrid clouds claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing burst computing capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">The term cloud was used to refer to platforms for distributed computing as early as 1993, when Apple spin-off General Magic and AT&T used it in describing their (paired) Telescript and Personal Link technologies. In Wired's April 1994 feature "Bill and Andy's Excellent Adventure II", Andy Hertzfeld commented on Telescript, General Magic's distributed programming language:

"The beauty of Telescript ... is that now, instead of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create a sort of a virtual service. No one had conceived that before. The example Jim White [the designer of Telescript, X.400 and ASN.1] uses now is a date-arranging service where a software agent goes to the flower store and orders flowers and then goes to the ticket shop and gets the tickets for the show, and everything is communicated to both parties.</p>
<center><img src="6th.jpg.jpg"></center>
<h2>Early history</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">During the 1960s, the initial concepts of time-sharing became popularized via RJE (Remote Job Entry); this terminology was mostly associated with large vendors such as IBM and DEC. Full-time-sharing solutions were available by the early 1970s on such platforms as Multics (on GE hardware), Cambridge CTSS, and the earliest UNIX ports (on DEC hardware). Yet, the "data center" model where users submitted jobs to operators to run on IBM's mainframes was overwhelmingly predominant.
    In the 1990s, telecommunications companies, who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering virtual private network (VPN) services with comparable quality of service, but at a lower cost. By switching traffic as they saw fit to balance server use, they could use overall network bandwidth more effectively.[citation needed] They began to use the cloud symbol to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was responsible for and what users were responsible for. Cloud computing extended this boundary to cover all servers as well as the network infrastructure. As computers became more diffused, scientists and technologists explored ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing.[citation needed] They experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure, platform, and applications, to prioritize tasks to be executed by CPUs, and to increase efficiency for end users.
    he use of the cloud metaphor for virtualized services dates at least to General Magic in 1994, where it was used to describe the universe of "places" that mobile agents in the Telescript environment could go. As described by Andy Hertzfeld:
    "The beauty of Telescript," says Andy, "is that now, instead of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create a sort of a virtual service.
    The use of the cloud metaphor is credited to General Magic communications employee David Hoffman, based on long-standing use in networking and telecom. In addition to use by General Magic itself, it was also used in promoting AT&T's associated PersonaLink Services.
    <h3>2000s</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">In July 2002, Amazon created subsidiary Amazon Web Services, with the goal to "enable developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own." In March 2006 Amazon introduced its Simple Storage Service , followed by Elastic Compute Cloud in August of the same year. These products pioneered the usage of server virtualization to deliver IaaS at a cheaper and on-demand pricing basis.
In April 2008, Google released the beta version of Google App Engine. The App Engine was a PaaS (one of the first of its kind) which provided fully maintained infrastructure and a deployment platform for users to create web applications using common languages/technologies such as Python, Node.js and PHP. The goal was to eliminate the need for some administrative tasks typical of an IaaS model, while creating a platform where users could easily deploy such applications and scale them to demand.
In early 2008, NASA's Nebula,enhanced in the RESERVOIR European Commission-funded project, became the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds, and for the federation of clouds.
By mid-2008, Gartner saw an opportunity for cloud computing "to shape the relationship among consumers of IT services, those who use IT services and those who sell them" and observed that "organizations are switching from company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based models" so that the "projected shift to computing ... will result in dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and significant reductions in other areas."
In 2008, the U.S. National Science Foundation began the Cluster Exploratory program to fund academic research using Google-IBM cluster technology to analyze massive amounts of data.</p>
<h3>2010s</h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">In February 2010, Microsoft released Microsoft Azure, which was announced in October 2008.

In July 2010, Rackspace Hosting and NASA jointly launched an open-source cloud-software initiative known as OpenStack. The OpenStack project intended to help organizations offering cloud-computing services running on standard hardware. The early code came from NASA's Nebula platform as well as from Rackspace's Cloud Files platform. As an open-source offering and along with other open-source solutions such as CloudStack, Ganeti, and OpenNebula, it has attracted attention by several key communities. Several studies aim at comparing these open source offerings based on a set of criteria.
On March 1, 2011, IBM announced the IBM SmartCloud framework to support Smarter Planet. Among the various components of the Smarter Computing foundation, cloud computing is a critical part. On June 7, 2012, Oracle announced the Oracle Cloud.[41] This cloud offering is poised to be the first to provide users with access to an integrated set of IT solutions, including the Applications (SaaS), Platform (PaaS), and Infrastructure (IaaS) layers.
In May 2012, Google Compute Engine was released in preview, before being rolled out into General Availability in December 2013.
In 2019, Linux was the most common OS used on Microsoft Azure. In December 2019, Amazon announced AWS Outposts, which is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any customer datacenter, co-location space, or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience.</p>

<h2><b>Similar concepts</b></h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">The goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies, without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them. The cloud aims to cut costs and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles. The main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization. Virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more "virtual" devices, each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks. With operating system–level virtualization essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices, idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently. Virtualization provides the agility required to speed up IT operations and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization. Autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources on-demand. By minimizing user involvement, automation speeds up the process, reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors.
    Cloud computing uses concepts from utility computing to provide metrics for the services used. Cloud computing attempts to address QoS (quality of service) and reliability problems of other grid computing models.
    <h3>Cloud computing shares characteristics with:</h3>
    <p><ol style="font-size: 20px;"><li>Client–server model—Client–server computing refers broadly to any distributed application that distinguishes between service providers (servers) and service requestors (clients).</li>
<li>Computer bureau—A service bureau providing computer services, particularly from the 1960s to 1980s.</li>
<li>Grid computing—A form of distributed and parallel computing, whereby a 'super and virtual computer' is composed of a cluster of networked, loosely coupled computers acting in concert to perform very large tasks.</li>
<li>Fog computing—Distributed computing paradigm that provides data, compute, storage and application services closer to the client or near-user edge devices, such as network routers. Furthermore, fog computing handles data at the network level, on smart devices and on the end-user client-side (e.g. mobile devices), instead of sending data to a remote location for processing.</li>
<li>Utility computing—The "packaging of computing resources, such as computation and storage, as a metered service similar to a traditional public utility, such as electricity.</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer—A distributed architecture without the need for central coordination. Participants are both suppliers and consumers of resources (in contrast to the traditional client-server model).</li>
<li>Cloud sandbox—A live, isolated computer environment in which a program, code or file can run without affecting the application in which it runs.</li>
